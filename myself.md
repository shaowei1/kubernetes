scheduled the application to run on that Node
configured the cluster to reschedule the instance on a new Node when needed

## Kubernetes Pods

When you created a Deployment in Module [2](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-intro/), Kubernetes created a **Pod** to host your application instance. A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker or rkt), and some shared resources for those containers. Those resources include:

- Shared storage, as Volumes
- Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
- Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

A Pod models an application-specific "logical host" and can contain different application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. For example, a Pod might include both the container with your Node.js app as well as a different container that feeds the data to be published by the Node.js webserver. The containers in a Pod share an IP Address and port space, are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context on the same Node.

Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. When we create a Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside them (as opposed to creating containers directly). Each Pod is tied to the Node where it is scheduled, and remains there until termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. In case of a Node failure, identical Pods are scheduled on other available Nodes in the cluster.

### Summary:

*A Pod is a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker or rkt) and includes shared storage (volumes), IP address and information about how to run them.*

Kubernetes [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/) are mortal. Pods in fact have a [lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/). When a worker node dies, the Pods running on the Node are also lost. A [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) might then dynamically drive the cluster back to desired state via creation of new Pods to keep your application running. As another example, consider an image-processing backend with 3 replicas. Those replicas are exchangeable; the front-end system should not care about backend replicas or even if a Pod is lost and recreated. That said, each Pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique IP address, even Pods on the same Node, so there needs to be a way of automatically reconciling changes among Pods so that your applications continue to function.

A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable a loose coupling between dependent Pods. A Service is defined using YAML [(preferred)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#general-configuration-tips)or JSON, like all Kubernetes objects. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a *LabelSelector* (see below for why you might want a Service without including `selector` in the spec).

Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs are not exposed outside the cluster without a Service. Services allow your applications to receive traffic. Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a `type` in the ServiceSpec:

- *ClusterIP* (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.
- *NodePort* - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. Superset of ClusterIP.
- *LoadBalancer* - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.
- *ExternalName* - Exposes the Service using an arbitrary name (specified by `externalName` in the spec) by returning a CNAME record with the name. No proxy is used. This type requires v1.7 or higher of `kube-dns`.

A Service routes traffic across a set of Pods. Services are the abstraction that allow pods to die and replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your application. Discovery and routing among dependent Pods (such as the frontend and backend components in an application) is handled by Kubernetes Services.

Services match a set of Pods using [labels and selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels), a grouping primitive that allows logical operation on objects in Kubernetes. Labels are key/value pairs attached to objects and can be used in any number of ways:

- Designate objects for development, test, and production
- Embed version tags
- Classify an object using tags

#  Exposing Your App

```bash
kubectl get services

# create a new service and expose it to external traffic
kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080

#  list the current Services from our cluster:
kubectl get services

# To find out what port was opened externally (by the NodePort option) weâ€™ll run the describe service command:
kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp

# Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node port assigned:
export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT

curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

#  Using labels
# The Deployment created automatically a label for our Pod. With describe deployment command you can see the name of the label:
kubectl describe deployment

kubectl get pods -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp

kubectl get services -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp

export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME

kubectl label pod $POD_NAME app=v1

kubectl describe pods $POD_NAME

kubectl get pods -l app=v1

# Deleting a service
kubectl delete service -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp

kubectl get services
curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT
kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME curl localhost:8080



```

#  Scaling Your App

```bash
# list your deployments
kubectl get deployments


kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4

kubectl get deployments

kubectl get pods -o wide

kubectl describe deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp

#  Load Balancing
export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT

curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

# Scale Down
kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=2


```

# update a deployed application with kubectl set image and to rollback with the rollout undo command.

```bash
kubectl get deployments

kubectl get pods

kubectl describe pods

# To update the image of the application to version 2, use the set image command, followed by the deployment name and the new image version:
kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2

kubectl get pods



```
